# SEFinalProject-DatingSime
Creating a Dating sim for final project in Musser Software engineering class

This project used the Unity Engine to build the mainframe for reading textfile and creating scenes.
A text file with specific parameters is attach to a scene, where the engine parses with and turns into a tree.
the tree is then read through and output as text on the game scene.

The two main files for the game are [Game1_Script.cs](https://github.com/jsho574/SEFinalProject-DatingSime/blob/master/CS_DatingSim/Assets/Scripts/Game1_Script.cs) and [DialogTree.cs](https://github.com/jsho574/SEFinalProject-DatingSime/blob/master/CS_DatingSim/Assets/Scripts/DialogTree.cs).

there is also a zip of the game project including the files and exe.
