MainChar:When I step the first thing I noticed is a woman buried in her work 
MainChar:She seems to be busy with a computer and it is hooked up to a little robot 
MainChar:The robot seems to be moving around, the woman though doesn't look up at me 
Java:Good to see you here 
MainChar:I jumped a little as Java came up behind me 
Java:Didn't mean to scare you there, I see that you have met C 
MainChar:I don't know if met is the right word 
Java:Yeah, she can be in her own world with her machines, but she's our senior president 
C:Oh, sorry I didn't see you, I was, yeah, sorry 
MainChar:You're fine, just busy I can see, this coding club after all, you seem to fill the role of that well 
MainChar:Her expression brightens 
C:Thank you, I was just seeing what I could do with this little guy 
<CHOICE>
action:2
Choice:He's a cute little robot 
Choice:If I can play with kits like that I think I am already warming up to here 
</CHOICE>
<ACTION>
MainChar:C looks at me a little strange, maybe that wasn't quite right 
Java:Good try MAINCHAR_NAME, you could use some help on trying to be smooth 
Java:Good try MAINCHAR_NAME, you could use some help on trying to be smooth

Java:Well, that will depend what you want to be doing with yourself here, robotics probably won't be the way to pick up some chicks.

MainChar:I'm just looking to get a footing, not trying to attach someone just yet 
Java:suuurrrreee 
MainChar:despite the playful sarcasm, Java look somewhat disapointed in my answer 
PHP:HERE! 
MainChar:PHP bursted into the room, already showing a stark contrast to C 
C:Hello PHP. 
Java:We're finally all here, lets get down to business 
MainChar:Wait, what, when I signed up for this club I was expecting more like nerdy guys with huge rim glasses. 
MainChar:Well, maybe I could spend time trying to pick up a girl if I'm going to be spending my time here. 
C:PHP, would you mind letting me see the list of new people from the event 
PHP:you'll be disappointed, the only name is already here. 
MainChar:PHP handed a usb to C 
C:Well, we only need four to make this a club so I think this is good 
Java:You are going to stay apart of this club, right MAINCHAR_NAME? 
MainChar:Java eyes seem to twinkle with that last sentence, I am just now noticing stuff? 
MainChar:I don't see the harm, it is something I am interested in. 
Java:You are a life saver 
PHP:That's true, besides, how could we got get the person Java has be saying we should be getting. 
MainChar:Not sure what to make of that I look over at Java 
Java:PHP!, don't be saying stuff like that, I just knew he would come through. He did an awesome build for our middle school track team website 
PHP:Ah, you've done stuff on the web, I want to see if we can learn off each other 
C:I can get a kit ready for you, you sounded interested before in the robot 
Java:I'm making a program for a client to sort their product types, if you want a look 
<CHOICE>
action:2
Choice:Work with web pages 
Choice:look a the robot kit 
</CHOICE>
<ACTION>
MainChar:Sure, I still have a lot to learn when it comes to web development, I'm sure to learn more 
MainChar:PHP look giddy at me a smiles at Java 
PHP:Awesome, lets start with the club's website 
MainChar:As I begin working on the website with PHP, I seem to remember more than I thought I would but see out paced me. 
PHP:I can see why Java wanted you here, you love learning and have a brain that recalls well 
</ACTION>
<ACTION>
MainChar:Sweet, I've always wanted to build one 
MainChar:C smiles at me and goes to the closet to grab a kit 
C:Lets get started with this one 
MainChar:The bot was a small one with wheel to just program it to go in a direction and turn, looked perfect 
C:You seem to be getting a handle on it, and I'm glad someone here shares a similar passion with code and machines 
</ACTION>
MainChar:I feel like I'm blushing and the other two seem to be looking 
MainChar:A few hours pass and the first day is over 
MainChar:As I make it home, I only smile at thinking about what the future in room 404 will be like.
